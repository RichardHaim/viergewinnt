RULES OF THE GAME:
The game is played on a vertical board which has seven columns and six rows. 
The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four OWN pieces (in our version of the game the pieces will be
"X" and "O"). The Line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. Moves are made alternatively, one by turn.
If none reaches to put 4 pieces in a line, its a draw.
