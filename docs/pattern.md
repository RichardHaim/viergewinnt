# Design Pattern: _Iterator_
In python, you can choose to iterate an array either with a "while", or with a "for" loop. The difference is, that the for-loop is built into python and will iterate through the full array, whereas the while-loop needs a manual setup. A while-loop can be stopped at a choosen event, the for-loop will always run through every element of the array until the very last element.

## The "for"-loop

The for-loop consists of the builtin methods `Ã¬ter()` and `next()`. If the array is no container, a `TypeError` is raised. `next()` will continue until  the container is empty and raise the exception `StopIteration`as an end point.

A most basic for-loop can look like this:
```sh
bucket = ["a", "c", "b", "d"]
for items in bucket:
    print(items)

>> a
>> c
>> b
>> d
```
The array `bucket` is printed in exactly the same order, as the content appears in the array itself.

## Nested Loop
Loops can be nested, meaning that a loop itselfs contains at least one other additional loop. This is especially helpful, if the code should iterate through an array in the style of nested lists, like `nested_list = [["item1","item2"],["item2","item2"]]`. A nested loop is able to access each item within each list contained in the variable `nested_list`. A basic example code looks like this:
```sh
nested_list = [["item1","item2"],["itemx","itemy"]]
for list in nested_list:
    for item in list:
        print(item)

>> item1
>> item2
>> itemx
>> itemy
```
