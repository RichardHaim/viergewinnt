# **Connect Four** #
## ***Rules:***
Connect-Four is a tic-tac-toe-like two-player game in which players alternately place pieces on a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high. Each player uses pieces of a particular color(in our version of the game black and red), and the object is to be the first to obtain four pieces in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. Becausethe board is vertical, pieces inserted in a given column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column. As soon as a column contains 6 pieces, it is full and no other piece can be placed in the collumn. 

Both players begin with 21 identical pieces and **the first player to achieve a line of four connected pieces wins the game**. If all 42 pieces are played and no player placed four pieces in a row, the game is drawn.
